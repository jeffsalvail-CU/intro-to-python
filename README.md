# intro-to-python

Hello, world! And welcome to the intro to Python workshop. 

My goals with this workshop are to:
  1) Demystify coding
  2) Show what you can do with a little practice
  3) Set you up so you can leave with working examples and begin teaching yourself
  
Before coming to the workshop, please complete the following:
  1) Visit https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/ and
     download the appropriate installer for your OS.
     Choose Mac or PC, and choose the latest version (Python 3.7)
  2) Install it.
  3) Test it. Launch the Anaconda Navigator and then click "Launch" under Jupyter Notebook.
     This should open a new tab in your default browser, but the URL will be localhost:8888/tree
     or something similar. Although it's in the browser, "localhost" means it's not online.
     
     The Jupyter Notebook is the main way we will be using Python.
     There are other ways I will also show, but this is my favourite.
  4) That's it!

I have uploaded notebooks from the workshop here. I included a little puzzle at the end of one, I suggest you give it a try!
